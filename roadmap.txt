Learn It, Girl! Roadmap

Brainstorm: A web application that has databases, uses Python for back-end, and does something cool.
Maybe with randomization or machine learning or a visualization of data ~ something about traveling?
Like something pretty showing how many people take flights to and from places. Colors for cost of flight?
--> could even do just one airline. 
Or even just travel in general --> trains and planes --> different colors for each. 

Project: A web application that visualizes flight data in the Northeast by cost, distance, time-traveled, etc.

- Narrow region
- Get sample data for that region


Week 1:
- Create Hello World in Python 3

- Start learning Django
- Get test data

Week 3:
- Start working on the main database
- Learn basic SQL
- Define tables and relations
- Continue learning Django
- Continue getting test data

Week 4:
- Finish database functionality
- Solve any bugs

Week 5:
- Work on getting live flight data -> parsing from something online 

Week 6:
- Continue work on getting live flight data -> parsing from something online

Week 7:
- Learn about back-end and begin implementing
- Making calls to the database
- Minimal front-end

Week 8:
